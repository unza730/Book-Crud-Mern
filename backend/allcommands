. express is our main framework
. mongoose is used to connect/interact with MongoDB

4)to install nodemon
npm i -D nodemon


nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.



At this point, if we change anything, we need to restart the server manually. But if we set up nodemon, then we don’t have to restart it every time; nodemon will watch if there is any change and restart the server automatically.



6)We need another dependency package called config for the global variable to run our project. Use the following command to install it to the project:

$ npm i config
